# Pattern Atlas
A common concept for documenting proven solutions and best practices for recurring problems are "patterns".
Patterns provide a textual description with a defined structure that supports the design process of complex systems. Patterns that capture knowledge from a certain domain are organized in a "pattern language".
This also makes it possible to document relationships between patterns, e.g., when certain patterns are frequently used together.

The Pattern Atlas is a pattern repository where different pattern languages can be stored and accessed.
Explore the pattern atlas and find out which proven solutions and best practices have already been collected!
