# Manage Organizations

Besides their individual accounts, users of the PlanQK platform can also be associated with some organization, e.g. as an employee of a company.
In that context users might want to be able to e.g. publish algorithms or services, as well as execute jobs either as an individual or as part of such an organization.
So, **assuming you are a member of an organization**, you should be aware of the **Account Context** in the top left corner, right above the different sections whenever you are doing something on the platform.

**Note**: When you are not a member of an organization you will not see the context-drop-down menu associated to it.

::: tip IMPORTANT
- As of now, after creating a new service, algorithm, etc. you are **NOT** able to change its context. So, before you do something new, be sure to have selected the correct context for the content you are about to create.
- Refreshing your browser resets the context to your personal account.
  :::

Being a member of an organization you can have one of multiple roles (similar to the roles associated to an algorithm or an implementation).
This, and anything related to your organization(s) can be seen in the corresponding section in the user drop-down menu in the top right corner.
Depending on your role for the organizations you belong to, you can see different information, e.g. other members or the general information.

### Manage Organizations

In the drop-down menu of your personal account in the top right corner you can select the section "Organizations".
Besides the ones your account is already associated to, you also have the option to create a new organization in the top right corner, which requires a name and a billing email.  
In order to allow members of your organization to run quantum services or jobs you should also consider adding a valid Quantum API token.
