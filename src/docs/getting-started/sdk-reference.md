# SDK Reference

The `planqk-quantum` library is a SDK for developing quantum circuits using [Qiskit](https://pypi.org/project/qiskit) to be run on quantum devices 
provided by the [PlanQK Platform](https://docs.platform.planqk.de).
The library is a wrapper for the [Qiskit SDK](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-metapackage) and provides the same functionality and syntax.

## Installation

The package is released on PyPI and can be installed via `pip`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade planqk-quantum
```

## Quantum Backends

### IonQ Quantum simulator
GPU-accelerated idealized simulator supporting up to 29 qubits,
using the same set of gates IonQ provide on its quantum hardwareâ€”a great place to preflight jobs before running them on an actual quantum computer.

### IonQ Harmony
The IonQ Harmony is a trapped ion quantum computer and is dynamically reconfigurable in software to use up to 11 qubits.
All qubits are fully connected, meaning you can run a two-qubit gate between any pair.
For details see the [specification](https://ionq.com/quantum-systems/harmony)

### IonQ Aria
IonQ Aria is IonQ's latest generation of trapped-ion quantum computer. 
With a 23-qubit dynamically reconfigurable system.
For details see the [specification](https://ionq.com/quantum-systems/aria)

### Rigetti Aspen-M-3
Rigetti quantum processors are universal, gate-model machines based on tunable superconducting qubits.
Rigetti Aspen-M-3 is a 79-qubit processor based on scalable multi-chip technology and features enhanced readout capabilities that contribute to better overall circuit fidelities independent of depth and width.
For details see the [specification](https://qcs.rigetti.com/qpus)

### Oxford Quantum Circuits (OQC) Lucy
Oxford Quantum Circuits (OQC) quantum computers are universal, gate-based machines based on superconducting qubits built using proprietary 'Coaxmon' technolog.
OQC Lucy offers an 8 qubit QPU with a topology of a ring where each qubit is connected to its 2 nearest neighbors.
For details see the [specification](https://oxfordquantumcircuits.com/technology)

### :eyes: Coming Soon

We are working on adding more quantum backends to the PlanQK Platform. The following backends are coming soon:

- IBM Quantum
