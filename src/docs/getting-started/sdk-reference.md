The `planqk-quantum` library is a SDK for developing quantum circuits using [Qiskit](https://pypi.org/project/qiskit) to be run on quantum devices
provided by the [PlanQK Platform](https://docs.platform.planqk.de).
The library is a wrapper for the [Qiskit SDK](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-metapackage) and provides the same functionality and syntax.

## Installation

The package is released on PyPI and can be installed via `pip`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade planqk-quantum
```
