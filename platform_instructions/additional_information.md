# Additional information

### Add tokens to your account
When you want to execute services via real quantum backends, you must provide valid tokens, in order to communicate with IBM's or DWave's devices.  
To add a token, go to the user-menu in the top right corner and click on "Settings". Under "Quantum Backend Tokens" you can add one to your account.  

**Important:**
These tokens will be used when you hand over a valid cloud `"backend"` (e.g. `"ibmq_qasm_simulator"`) within the `"params"` object in your request.
